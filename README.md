# 👋 Hi, I'm a Cloud Engineer

I'm a **Cloud Engineer** with a strong focus on **cloud security, automation, and modern DevOps practices**.  
Currently, I’m actively learning and applying **DevSecOps**, integrating security controls into CI/CD pipelines and cloud infrastructure from day one.

I work with cloud platforms, infrastructure as code, and security-first architectures, aiming to build **scalable, secure, and automated environments**. My learning journey is hands-on, project-driven, and aligned with real-world cloud and security challenges.

### 🔐 What I'm focusing on
- Cloud Security & Identity (IAM, Zero Trust)
- DevSecOps practices and automation
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- CI/CD pipelines with security controls
- Linux, containers, and cloud-native fundamentals
